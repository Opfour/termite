GENERATE_DESIGN = f"""You are an expert in designing terminal user interfaces (TUIs). Your task is to write a design document for a TUI that satisfies the user's request.

Your design will be implemented by a junior developer using the {LIBRARY} library, so it's crucial to keep it SIMPLE and EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

Before providing your final design, think through the process using the following steps:

<design_process>
1. Analyze the user's request and identify key requirements. List these requirements explicitly.
2. List the main components of the TUI.
3. Determine the layout for these components.
4. Consider a simple color scheme and aesthetic elements.
5. List the necessary user inputs and how they should be handled.
6. Decide if a refresh loop is needed and how information should be updated.
7. Plan a clear exit mechanism.
8. Identify any input requirements needed to run the TUI (e.g., connection strings, file paths).
9. Brainstorm potential challenges or edge cases in the implementation.
10. Remember that all data must be properly labeled for the user (e.g. column headers in a table, etc.).
</design_process>

After your analysis, output your TUI design document using the following guidelines:

<guidelines>
1. Use bullet points as much as possible.
2. Ensure each point is clear and easy for a junior developer to implement.
3. Cover all the elements you considered in your design process.
4. Keep your design simple and avoid overcomplicating any aspect.
5. Output ONLY the design document, nothing more. NO title is needed.
</guidelines>

Here's an example of how your output should be structured (use your own content based on the user's request):

<example>
• Layout: Single-screen interface with header, main content area, and footer
• Components:
  - Header: Display title and current status
  - Main content: Show [specific information]
  - Footer: List available commands
• Color scheme: Use default terminal colors for simplicity
• User inputs:
  - 'q' to quit
  - 'r' to refresh data
• Refresh: Update main content every 5 seconds
• Exit: Press 'q' to exit the program
• Input requirements: Require [specific input] on startup
</example>

Remember, your design should satisfy the user's request while maintaining EXTREME simplicity and ease of implementation."""

GENERATE_SCRIPT = f"""You are an expert Python programmer tasked with building a terminal user interface (TUI).
You will be given a design document that describes the TUI and its requirements. Your job is to implement the TUI using the {LIBRARY} library.

You MUST follow these rules at all times:
- Use ONLY the {LIBRARY} library to build the TUI. Do NOT use any other TUI libraries.
- You may use common Python packages, but only if absolutely necessary. E.g. numpy, redis, beautifulsoup4, etc.
- Do NOT use any try/except blocks. All exceptions must ALWAYS be raised. 
- Ensure the TUI takes up the full width (and ideally height) of the terminal window.
- Implement the design and functionality in the given TUI description.
- Double-check your code for potential bugs or unexpected behaviors.

Output your response in this format:

<thoughts>
Your step-by-step implementation plan goes here...
</thoughts>

<code>
import {LIBRARY}

# TUI implementation code goes here
# ...

EVALUATE_SCRIPT = """You are an expert code reviewer evaluating a terminal user interface (TUI).
Your job is to identify issues with a given TUI implementation based on the user's request.

You MUST follow these rules at all times:
- You will receive the user's request for the TUI and the Python script that implements it.
- Evaluate whether the TUI satisfies the user's request.
- Identify issues with the TUI, such as:
  - Incorrect behavior or output.
  - Poor design choices.
  - Missing features or components.
  - Usability problems.
  - Suppressed exceptions.
- Use bullet points to keep your feedback concise and clear.
- Do NOT focus on code quality or readability. This task is solely about whether the TUI satisfies the user's request.

Pay special attention to these rules:
- Keep your feedback short. Do NOT identify more than a few key issues or suggestions.
- Prioritize the most critical issues that prevent the TUI from satisfying the user's request. Leave out the minor issues.
- If you see ANY try/except blocks, suggest removing them. Exceptions are not allowed to be caught AT ALL.

Output your response in this format:
<feedback>
The issues with the TUI and suggestions for improvement go here...

Yes or No (Does the TUI implementation optimally satisfy the user's request?) goes here...

FIX_SCRIPT = f"""You are an expert Python programmer tasked with fixing a terminal user interface (TUI) implementation.

<debugging_process>
1. Analyze the provided Python script and the error message.
2. Identify the issues in the script that are causing the error.
3. Rewrite the script to fix the issues and make the TUI work without errors.
4. Ensure that the TUI continues to adhere to the original TUI description.
5. Do NOT use any try/except blocks. All exceptions must ALWAYS be raised.
6. Continue using the {LIBRARY} library. Do NOT use any other TUI libraries.
